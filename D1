Maybe this 100DaysOfX will help me to stay on track.
So I commit to 30mins of learning something practical computer sciency every day for the next 100 days.

Starting with the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate Course from Udemy.
I want to avoid getting distracted constantly by starting new things, I will stick to this and complete it before I start something new.
Suggestions for next topics, in no particular order):
- Command Line
- RegEx
- Linux
(Maybe it will also help me get more familiar with Github, for example by finding out how I keep like a list of ideas for next things.)

I'm currently on lecture/video 24 (Storage Gateway), and for the first time on this course thinking that I'm slightly confused with what he's talking about... it started with the Video 21/22 on CDN that didn't fully make sense, but maybe I just lack a sense of what you would need it for.
Now he's on this Storage Gateway topic, and it's again not fully making sense, although I can't completely pin down, why.
Anyway.

This is Day 1 of my 100DaysOfLearning challenge.
