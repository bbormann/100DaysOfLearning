Well *that* went well.. or not. Dropped off after two days for the usual reasons.
Now that I spend a lot of time waiting for queries to complete on the current project, I've thought that I could use the down time to finish (or at least continue) the AWS course on Udemy.

Nice things though:
- In the meantime, I used Python a lot and learned massively... considering starting flashcards to memorize stuff. So even though I did not continue on 100DaysofX, I did not stop learning.
- I'm sitting in the middle of a bunch of people doing a massive migration to AWS, and I overhear some of their discussions and chats, and I'm secretly enjoying that I UNDERSTAND what they're talking about.

So let's try this again!



LATER:
Of course I did not stick to the AWS course, but instead bought three other courses on Udemy - one on Python, two on visualisations with matplotlib.
I've downloaded most of the content for the AWS course and the Python course for tomorrow's flight to Sydney, so that I can continue learning.
