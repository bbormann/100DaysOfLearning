Day 2.
Had to kick myself a bit to do it today, but thought that it would be fairly stupid to fail on day 2 of this challenge already. Also because I haven't done ANYTHING productive today.
So, I watched the review lecture on S3 and took the quiz, and unsurprisingly failed by a few things that were in the S3 101, which I watched like ages ago.
I also watched the EC2 101 lecture, and that was really good, because it covers more of the topics that I would consider useful, mostly because all the examples in the S3 lecture felt slightly - can't think of the right word, posh maybe, or just playful, but in a negative sense.
It made me remember that I don't have to get myself a new machine to try out Linux, I can actually just get myself an EC2 instance (d'oh).
Interesting question from one of the slides though: on X1, he puts SAP HANA/Apache Spark next to each other, as extreme memory use cases.
Now I'm slightly confused because I never considered HANA and Spark to be in the same category of things...

I should go back to my idea from driving from Wanaka/Lake Hawea over to Queenstown: start building up a mind map of all computer sciency things, topics, names, labels, and attach a one-sentence-definition to them, so that I can start relating them to concepts I know.
(I really should do that because it seems like a really good investment of my time, but now I need to miss NZ for a bit.)
